                <strong>Important:</strong> YoMo is science based (not religious). No singing, no chakras, no gurus and no oms. Forget all stereotypes, I teach yoga for health and well-being and have no affiliation with any religion or dogma. I welcome people of all faiths, sexuality and gender.

                  <li>Injuries that occur are often re-injuries - old problems reappear.</li>
                  <li>Muscle pain experienced during training is often not severe. Muscles are well supplied with blood and heal relatively quickly.</li>
                  <li>Pressure pain is mostly harmless and can be relieved with a pillow, yoga blocks, or modifications.</li>
                  <li>Many doctors recommend yoga as part of therapy. Movement can heal!</li>
                  <li>Sudden, stabbing joint pain is problematic. If you experience this pain, stop exercising and consult a doctor.</li>
